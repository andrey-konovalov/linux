description: |-
  The Sony imx219 is a 1/4.0-inch CMOS active pixel digital image sensor
  with an active array size of 3280H x 2464V. It is programmable through
  I2C interface. The I2C address is fixed to 0x10 as per sensor data sheet.
  Image data is sent through MIPI CSI-2, which is configured as either 2 or
  4 data lanes.

  VDIG-supply:
    description:
      Digital I/O voltage supply, 1.8 volts

  xclr-gpios:
    description: |-
      Reference to the GPIO connected to the xclr pin, if any.
      Must be released after all supplies are applied.
      This is an active high signal to the imx219.

  clock-noncontinuous:
    description: |-
      Presence of this boolean property decides whether the MIPI CSI-2 clock
      is continuous or non-continuous.

  camera-clk: true

  port: true

  data-lanes:
    description: |-
      Should be <1 2 3 4> for four-lane operation, or <1 2> for two-lane
      operation.
